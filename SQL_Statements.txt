========== SQL QUESTIONS FROM EMPLOYMENT TEST =======================

I ran all these queries though SQL Fiddle on the Internet

1.Write a SQL Query to pull all customers

	SELECT * From Customers;

2.Write a SQL Query to pull all customers that have orders (no duplicatese)

	SELECT DISTINCT Customers.Name
		FROM Customers, Orders
		WHERE Customers.id = Orders.CUSTOMER_ID;

3.Write a SQL Query to pull all customers that do not have orders

	SELECT Name 
		FROM Customers 
		LEFT JOIN Orders on Customers.id = Orders.CUSTOMER_ID
		WHERE Orders.CUSTOMER_ID is NULL

4.If you had to create an index on these tables, which fields would you most likely index and why?

	I would create an index on "Customer Name" since this is the most likely search term

	I would create an index on "Customer_ID" since this a most likely search team and would
	speed up the join query of customer with customer orders

5.Write a query that lists each customer name, email, and the number of order they have

	SELECT DISTINCT Customers.Name,
		   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders where Customers.ID = Orders.CUSTOMER_ID)
			FROM Customers, Orders

6.Write a query that pulls all customers that have between 2 and 5 orders

		SELECT C.Name As CustomerName, COUNT(O.Customer_ID) As TotalOrders
			FROM Customers AS C
			INNNER JOIN Orders AS O ON C.ID = O.Customer_ID 
			GROUP BY O.Customer_ID
			HAVING COUNT(O.Customer_ID) BETWEEN 2 AND 5
